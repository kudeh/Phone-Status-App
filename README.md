# Phone-Status-App
Phone Status App is Installed On My Phone and built using Cordova. It sends sensor data about my phone such as Battery Level, Location, Network Status, Speed and Direction via a POST Request to my Web server which is running Nodejs. The phone information is then displayed on a website. Information gotten from my phone was also stored in a PostgresSQL Database which was running on my server.
